### Threenine Database configuration Helper

Provides a helper to ease the configuration of Entity Framework Code First database projects when using the 
`IEntityTypeConfiguration` pattern. Offering an opinionated approach to relational database design patterns, with helper 
classes to configure both Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases, primarily because these are the two most common
relational database engines used in the Enterprise Software solutions and typically what we use at Threenine.
